# machine-learning

A curated collection of academic and professional machine learning projects that demonstrate a wide range of techniques, from classical algorithms to modern ensemble methods. Each project follows a complete workflow: data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model building, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and result interpretation.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into individual project folders, each containing its own README, data sources (or links), Jupyter notebooks/scripts, and results.
